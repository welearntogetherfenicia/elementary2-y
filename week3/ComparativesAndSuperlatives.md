# Comparatives and Superlatives

## 1. Comparative and Superlative Adjectives

### Comparative Adjectives
Comparative adjectives are used to **compare a certain characteristic or quality** between two or more things, animals or people.

**Example:**

|<img src="/assets/images/14-01-es.jpg" alt="Song1" width="300"/>|
|:--------------------------------------------------------------:|
|*The mouse is smaller than the owl.*|

---

### Superlative Adjectives
Superlative adjectives express the **maximum degree of a characteristic** of an element in relation to others in the same group or condition.

**Example:**

|<img src="/assets/images/14-02-es.jpg" alt="Song1" width="300"/>|
|:--------------------------------------------------------------:|
|*The fastest car is the blue one.*|

## 2. How are Comparative and Superlative Adjectives Made?

In order to build comparative and superlative structures, some rules must be followed:

---

### One-syllable adjectives
- **Comparative:** add **-er**
- **Superlative:** add **-est** (usually preceded by *the*)

**Example:**

|<img src="/assets/images/14-03-es.jpg" alt="Song1" width="200"/>| <img src="/assets/images/14-04-es.jpg" alt="Song1" width="200"/> |<img src="/assets/images/14-05-es.jpg" alt="Song1" width="200"/>
|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
|*Tall*|*Taller*|*The tallest*|

#### Exceptions:

| Rule | Adjective | Comparative | Superlative |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Ends in **-e** | Wide | Wider | The widest |
| Ends in consonant + vowel + consonant | Big | Bigger | The biggest |

---

### Two-syllable adjectives
- **Comparative:** usually with *more* + adjective, or sometimes add **-er**
- **Superlative:** *the most* + adjective, or sometimes add **-est**

**Example:**
Clever → More clever / Cleverer → The most clever / The cleverest

#### Exceptions:

| Rule | Adjective | Comparative | Superlative |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Ends in **-y** | Easy | Easier | The easiest |

---

### Adjectives with three or more syllables
- **Comparative:** *more* + adjective
- **Superlative:** *the most* + adjective

**Example:**
Difficult → More difficult → The most difficult

---

### Irregular adjectives
Some adjectives have **their own forms** and don’t follow the rules:

| Adjective | Comparative | Superlative |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Good | Better | (The) Best |
| Bad | Worse | (The) Worst |
| Far | Further / Farther | (The) Furthest / Farthest |

---

## 3. Summary Table

| Adjective Type | Example | Comparative | Superlative |
|----------------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **One syllable** | Tall | Taller | The tallest |
| **Two syllables** | Clever | More clever / Cleverer | The most clever / The cleverest |
| **Two syllables ending in -y** | Happy | Happier | The happiest |
| **More than two syllables** | Dangerous | More dangerous | The most dangerous |
| **Irregular** | Good / Bad | Better / Worse | The best / The worst |

---

## 4. Remember!
- **Comparatives** compare **two elements**.
- **Superlatives** express the **highest degree** of a characteristic.
