### Important Note

In negative and interrogative sentences, the verb ***have to*** always needs the corresponding auxiliary. Do not use only the verb ***have***.

**Examples:**

<u>You don't have to wash</u> your hair daily.

~~You haven't to wash~~ your hair daily. ❌

*You don't have to wash your hair daily.*

---

<u>Did you have to work</u> on Saturday?

~~Had you to work~~ on Saturday? ❌

*Did you have to work on Saturday?*

## 2. Usage of Have to

***Have to*** is used to express **obligation** in **affirmative** sentences. In **negative** sentences it expresses **absence of obligation**.

### Examples:

I<u>'ll have to</u> wear a tie in my new job.

## 3. Differences Between Have to and Must

In affirmative form in the present, both ***must*** and ***have to*** are interchangeable in many cases. However, the use of ***have to*** is preferred when the obligation is **external, objective**. On the other hand, we use ***must*** when the obligation to perform the action comes from the speaker.

### Examples:

![IMG UNIT 12-04](https://course.lewolang.com/upload/imatges/grammar/a2/12-04-es.jpg)

I <u>have to</u> pick up my brother from school.

*I have to pick up my brother from school.*

**Comment:** As we can observe, the older brother has the obligation to pick up his younger brother from school because his mother asked him to, therefore **the obligation comes from the mother (external).**

I <u>must</u> finish the column today.

*I must finish the column today.*

**Comment:** As we can observe, this journalist **has the obligation** to finish an article so that it can be published in a short period of time. It is a personal imposition.

## 4. Don't Have to vs. Mustn't

In **negative sentences**, unlike ***mustn't*** which denotes **prohibition**, ***have to*** serves to express the **absence of an obligation or the lack of necessity to do something.** The translation would be *you don't need to* or *you don't have to*.

### Examples:

![IMG UNIT 12-06](https://course.lewolang.com/upload/imatges/grammar/a2/12-06-es.jpg)

You <u>didn't have to</u> bring anything.

*You didn't have to bring anything.*

**Comment:** This sentence is issued by a person who has organized a party. One of the guests has brought a bottle of wine and the hostess says this sentence to say that **it wasn't necessary**. Still, out of courtesy, they brought it.

We <u>won't have to</u> clean the car, it'll rain.

*We won't have to clean the car, it'll rain.*

**Comment:** This sentence is issued by a person who is looking at the weather forecast. Since it is not favorable, they tell the guy **that it is not necessary** to clean the car since there is a probability that it will rain and get dirty again.

## Additional Note

In British English, the form ***have got to*** is also often used instead of ***have to*** when using the present simple form.

**Example:**

I <u>have to</u> go / I <u>have got to</u> go.

*I have to go.*

***Must*** and ***have to*** indicate **obligation, prohibition or necessity**.

| Form | | Structure | Examples |

| **HAVE TO** | **+** | Subject + **have to** (corresponding tense) + infinitive | I've lost my wallet. I **have to** find it. <br> *I've lost my wallet. I have to find it.* |
| | **-** | Subject + **negative auxiliary** (corresponding tense) + **have to** + infinitive | You **won't have to** take anything home. <br> *You won't have to take anything home.* |
| | **?** | **Auxiliary** (corresponding tense) + subject + **have to** + infinitive | **Did** I **have to** come earlier? <br> *Did I have to come earlier?* |
