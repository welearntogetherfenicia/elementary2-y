## Lyrics
My life is brilliant<br />

My life is brilliant<br />
My love is pure<br />
I saw an angel<br />
Of that I'm sure<br />
She smiled at me on the subway<br />
She was with another man<br />
But I won't lose no sleep on that<br />
'Cause I've got a plan<br />

You're beautiful<br />
You're beautiful<br />
You're beautiful, it's true<br />
I saw your face in a crowded place<br />
And I don't know what to do<br />
'Cause I'll never be with you<br />

Yes, she caught my eye<br />
As we walked on by<br />
She could see from my face that I was<br />
Fucking high<br />
And I don't think that I'll see her again<br />
But we shared a moment that will last 'til the end<br />

You're beautiful<br />
You're beautiful<br />
You're beautiful, it's true<br />
I saw your face in a crowded place<br />
And I don't know what to do<br />
'Cause I'll never be with you<br />

La, la-la, la-la<br />
La, la-la, la-la<br />
La, la-la, la-la, la<br />

You're beautiful<br />
You're beautiful<br />
You're beautiful, it's true<br />
There must be an angel with a smile on her face<br />
When she thought up that I should be with you<br />
But it's time to face the truth<br />
I will never be with you<br />
