## Lyrics
[Verse 1] <br />
I got my first real six-string <br />
Bought it at the Five and Dime <br />
Played it 'til my fingers bled <br />
Was the summer of '69 <br />

[Verse 2] <br />
Me and some guys from school <br />
Had a band and we tried real hard <br />
Jimmy quit, Jody got married <br />
Should've known we'd never get far <br />

[Chorus] <br />
Oh, when I look back now <br />
That summer seemed to last forever <br />
And if I had the choice <br />
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there <br />
Those were the best days of my life <br />
Hey! <br />

[Verse 3] <br />
Ain't no use in complainin' <br />
When you got a job to do <br />
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in <br />
And that's when I met you, yeah <br />

[Chorus] <br />
Standin' on your mama's porch <br />
You told me that you'd wait forever <br />
Oh, and when you held my hand <br />
I knew that it was now or never <br />
Those were the best days of my life <br />

[Refrain] <br />
Oh, yeah <br />
Back in the summer of '69, ohh <br />

[Bridge] <br />
Man, we were killin' time <br />
We were young and restless <br />
We needed to unwind <br />
I guess nothing can last forever <br />
Forever, no! <br />
Yeah! <br />

[Verse 4] <br />
And now the times are changin' <br />
Look at everything that's come and gone <br />
Sometimes, when I play that old six-string <br />
Think about you, wonder what went wrong <br />

[Chorus] <br />
Standin' on your mama's porch <br />
You told me that it'd last forever <br />
Oh, and when you held my hand <br />
I knew that it was now or never <br />
Those were the best days of my life <br />

[Outro] <br />
Oh, yeah <br />
Back in the summer of '69, uh-huh <br />
It was the summer of '69, oh, yeah <br />
Me and my baby in a '69, ohh, ho! <br />
It was the summer, summer, summer of '69 <br />
Yeah
