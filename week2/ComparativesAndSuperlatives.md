# Comparatives and Superlatives

## 1. Comparative and Superlative Adjectives

### Comparative Adjectives
Comparative adjectives are used to **compare a certain characteristic or quality** between two or more things, animals or people.  

**Example:**  
*The mouse is smaller than the owl.*  

---

### Superlative Adjectives
Superlative adjectives express the **maximum degree of a characteristic** of an element in relation to others in the same group or condition.  

**Example:**  
*The fastest car is the blue one.*

## 2. How are Comparative and Superlative Adjectives Made?

In order to build comparative and superlative structures, some rules must be followed:

---

### One-syllable adjectives
- **Comparative:** add **-er**  
- **Superlative:** add **-est** (usually preceded by *the*)  

**Example:**  
Tall → Taller → The tallest  

#### Exceptions:
| Case | Comparative | Superlative |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Ends in **-e** | add **-r** | add **-st** |
| Example: Wide → Wider | The widest |
| Ends in consonant + vowel + consonant | double last consonant + **-er** | double last consonant + **-est** |
| Example: Big → Bigger | The biggest |

---

### Two-syllable adjectives
- **Comparative:** usually with *more* + adjective, or sometimes add **-er**  
- **Superlative:** *the most* + adjective, or sometimes add **-est**  

**Example:**  
Clever → More clever / Cleverer → The most clever / The cleverest  

#### Exceptions:
| Case | Comparative | Superlative |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Ends in **-y** | -y → -ier | -y → -iest |
| Example: Easy → Easier | The easiest |

---

### Adjectives with three or more syllables
- **Comparative:** *more* + adjective  
- **Superlative:** *the most* + adjective  

**Example:**  
Difficult → More difficult → The most difficult  

---

### Irregular adjectives
Some adjectives have **their own forms** and don’t follow the rules:

| Adjective | Comparative | Superlative |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Good | Better | (The) Best |
| Bad | Worse | (The) Worst |
| Far | Further / Farther | (The) Furthest / Farthest |

---

## 3. Summary Table

| Adjective Type | Example | Comparative | Superlative |
|----------------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **One syllable** | Tall | Taller | The tallest |
| **Two syllables** | Clever | More clever / Cleverer | The most clever / The cleverest |
| **Two syllables ending in -y** | Happy | Happier | The happiest |
| **More than two syllables** | Dangerous | More dangerous | The most dangerous |
| **Irregular** | Good / Bad | Better / Worse | The best / The worst |

---

## 4. Remember!
- **Comparatives** compare **two elements**.  
- **Superlatives** express the **highest degree** of a characteristic.
