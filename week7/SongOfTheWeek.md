## Lyrics
There's a fire starting in my heart <br />
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark <br />
Finally, I can see you crystal clear <br />
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare <br />

See how I'll leave with every piece of you <br />
Don't underestimate the things that I will do <br />

There's a fire starting in my heart <br />
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark <br />

The scars of your love remind me of us <br />
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all <br />
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless <br />
I can't help feeling <br />

We could've had it all <br />
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) <br />
Rolling in the deep <br />
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) <br />
You had my heart inside of your hand <br />
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) <br />
And you played it to the beat <br />
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) <br />

Baby, I have no story to be told <br />
But I've heard one of you and I'm gonna make your head burn <br />
Think of me in the depths of your despair <br />
Making home down there, as mine sure won't be shared <br />

(You're gonna wish you never had met me) <br />
The scars of your love remind me of us <br />
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) <br />
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all <br />
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) <br />
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless <br />
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) <br />
I can't help feeling <br />

We could've had it all <br />
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) <br />
Rolling in the deep <br />
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) <br />
You had my heart inside of your hand <br />
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) <br />
And you played it to the beat <br />
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) <br />

We could've had it all <br />
Rolling in the deep <br />
You had my heart inside of your hand <br />
But you played it with a beating <br />

Throw your soul through every open door <br />
Count your blessings to find what you look for <br />
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold <br />
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow <br />

(You're gonna wish you never had met me) <br />
We could've had it all <br />
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) <br />
We could've had it all <br />
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) <br />
It all, it all, it all <br />
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) <br />

We could've had it all <br />
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) <br />
Rolling in the deep <br />
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) <br />
You had my heart inside of your hand <br />
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) <br />
And you played it to the beat <br />
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) <br />

Could've had it all <br />
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) <br />
Rolling in the deep <br />
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) <br />
You had my heart inside of your hand <br />
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) <br />

But you played it <br />
You played it <br />
You played it <br />
You played it to the beat <br />
