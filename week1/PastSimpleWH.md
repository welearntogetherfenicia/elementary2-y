# WH-Questions in the Past Simple

### 1. What are WH-questions?

WH-questions are questions that begin with **question words** like:

* Who
* What
* Where
* When
* Why
* Which
* How

They are used to get specific information (not just *yes/no* answers).

---

### 2. Structure of WH-questions in Past Simple

The basic structure is:

**WH-word + did + subject + base form of the verb + rest of the sentence**

* "Did" is always used for Past Simple questions (except with the verb *to be*).
* The main verb stays in the **base form**, not in past.

### 3. Examples with different WH-words

| WH-word | Example Question                    | Example Answer            |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Who     | Who **did you meet** yesterday?     | I met my friend.          |
| What    | What **did she eat** for lunch?     | She ate pasta.            |
| Where   | Where **did they go** last night?   | They went to the cinema.  |
| When    | When **did he finish** the project? | He finished it on Monday. |
| Why     | Why **did you call** him?           | Because I needed help.    |
| Which   | Which movie **did you watch**?      | We watched *Titanic*.     |
| How     | How **did they travel** to Paris?   | They traveled by train.   |

### 4. Special case: verb *to be* in past (was/were)

When the main verb is *to be*, we do **not** use "did".

* WH-word + was/were + subject + rest of the sentence

Examples:

* Where **were you** yesterday? – I was at home.
* Who **was the teacher** last year? – Mr. Brown was the teacher.
