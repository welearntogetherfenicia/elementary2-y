## Regular and Irregular Verbs

In English, there are two types of verbs: regular and irregular. To construct the Past Simple correctly, we must know whether the main verb is regular or irregular.

### Regular Verbs

Regular verbs form the past by adding **-ed** to the verb. Here are the spelling rules:

| Ending | Rule | Examples |
|--------|------|----------|
| One-syllable verbs ending in consonant + vowel + consonant | Double the last consonant | Stop → Stopped<br>Chat → Chatted |
| Multi-syllable verbs ending in consonant + vowel + consonant (stress on last syllable) | Double the last consonant | Admit → Admitted<br>Permit → Permitted |
| Verbs ending in consonant + vowel + L | Double the L | Travel → Travelled<br>Cancel → Cancelled |
| Verbs ending in vowel + Y | Just add -ED | Play → Played<br>Stay → Stayed |
| Verbs ending in consonant + Y | Replace Y with -IED | Study → Studied<br>Tidy → Tidied |
| Verbs ending in -E | Add -D | Live → Lived<br>Like → Liked |

### Irregular Verbs

These verbs don't follow the -ed pattern. Here are common irregular verbs:

| Present | Past Simple | Past Participle |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Buy | Bought | Bought |
| Choose | Chose | Chosen |
| Put | Put | Put |
| Sing | Sang | Sung |

## Structure of Past Simple

### Affirmative Form
**Subject + verb (past form) + complement**

Examples:
- I enjoyed the holidays
- She worked last night
- They travelled to Canada

### Negative Form
**Subject + didn't + verb (infinitive) + complement**

Examples:
- I didn't enjoy the holidays
- She didn't work last night
- They didn't travel to Canada

{: .warning }
> Remember that in **negative** sentences the **verb** is used in the **infinitive** because the particle **did** already indicates that the sentence is in the past tense. The same thing will happen in **interrogative** sentences.

### Interrogative Form
**Did + subject + verb (infinitive) + complement?**

Examples:
- Did you enjoy the holidays?
- Did she work last night?
- Did they travel to Canada?

#### Short Answers
- **Yes:** Yes, I/you/he/she/it/we/they did
- **No:** No, I/you/he/she/it/we/they didn't

## Time Expressions

Common time expressions used with Past Simple:

| Expression | Example |
|------------|---------|
| Last week/month/year | It was his birthday last week |
| When I was... | When I was a child, I lived in London |
| Yesterday | It rained all day yesterday |
| ...ago | I won the lottery three years ago |
| The other day | I saw your brother the other day |

**Note:** *Last* comes before the time expression, but *ago* comes after.

## Summary
